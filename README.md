# Using Flutter Hydrated Bloc with Flutter Secure Storage

This powerful combination allows developers to persist their app's state directly into a secure storage.

Main packages used:
 * [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
 * [hydrated_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/hydrated_bloc)
 * [flutter_secure_storage](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage)

Reso Coder's [Flutter Bloc & Cubit Tutorial](https://github.com/ResoCoder/flutter-bloc-cubit-tutorial) was used as a base for this project.
